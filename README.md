# Foodventures | iOS Food Adventures Application

Ever see a nice restaurant on your friend's Instagram story or Snapchat?  
Ever scroll past delicious plates of food on Reddit or Facebook?  
Ever screenshot it and lose that restaurant in your photo library?  

Fear no more!  

## Foodventures will help you map out your next food adventure by saving locations on an interactive map.  
Instead of boring pins and unknown blobs, you will see clearly which type of cuisine with nice food icons!  

Saved a ramen place? Look for a ramen icon. üçú  
Saved a burger joint? You know how it goes. üçî  
Saved a pizzeria? Of course... üçï  

Your current location will show you what you are near and which adventure awaits you !!  

Currently in development. Will be in the app store soon.
